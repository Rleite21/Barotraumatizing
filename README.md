---------------------------------------------------------- BAROTRAUMATIZING v0.10 ------------------------------------------------

Barotraumatizing is an upcoming project to make a total overhaul of the game Barotrauma. Our aim is to create a more complex, realistic and fun experience to add to the already awesome game that is Barotrauma.

Some of the features (or soon to be) in this mod will be: 
    -New objects like tools, weapons, wardrobe;
    -New afflictions like hunger and related ilnesses;
    -New submarines with new installations (for example kitchens and better cargo bays);
    -New creatures;
    -A more complex DIY crafting system;
    -New missions!;
    
We also intend to add and develop a more expansive narrative and lore and many other content additions in later versions.

----------------------------------------------------- INSTALL GUIDE ------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to run Barotraumatizing is by downloading it through the steam workshop (perhaps not available yet), but you can also download the files and add them to the folder "LocalMods", that you can find within the Barotrauma game files.

After downloading the mod all you have to do is go to the mod menu in-game and enable Barotraumatizing.

DISCLAIMER: Barotraumatizing might collide and be incompatible with other mods or even certain versions of the actual game. If you happen to run into any bugs, crashes and issues, please let us know through our steam forums! :)
